# IMU Deskew: Correctness Gate + Measured Performance

Investigation on the real moving bag `real_slam_20260713_155904_0.mcap` (99s, 3 LiDARs +
3 IMUs, articulated chassis). Branch `ao/polka-9/deskew-perf-investigation` off `humble`.

## Environment

- Build/run: shared `isaac_ros_dev-x86_64-container` (ROS humble, CUDA 12.6 toolkit),
  source copied to `/home/pan-navigator/workspaces/polka9_ws/src/polka`, bag hardlinked
  in. Runtime tests isolated on `ROS_DOMAIN_ID=129` to avoid interfering with another
  session's active nodes in the same container.
- GPU is Blackwell (compute capability 12.0 / sm_120). The available CUDA 12.6 toolkit
  only supports up to `compute_90` SASS, and the repo's `CMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES`
  (`75;86;87`) doesn't cover sm_120 either way. Built CUDA with
  `-DCMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES=90-virtual` (PTX-only for compute_90); the CUDA-13-capable
  driver JIT-compiles it to sm_120 SASS at load. Verified this runs correctly (no
  `cudaErrorNoKernelImageForDevice`). This is a local test-rig setting only, **not**
  committed — unrelated to the deskew/perf changes.
- The bag's per-topic QoS metadata records `history: unknown, depth: 0` uniformly across
  every topic, which crashes `ros2 bag play`'s QoS-profile-to-`rclcpp::QoS` conversion
  (works fine for `ros2 bag info`, which doesn't need to construct real QoS objects).
  Fixed with `--qos-profile-overrides-path` supplying `{history: keep_last, depth: N}`
  per topic. Environment quirk, not a polka issue.

## Part A — Correctness gate: **PASS** (with one caveat, see below)

**Setup:** 3-source config (`airy_front/left_front/rear`), per-source IMU (1:1
lidar↔IMU), `output_frame_id: base_footprint`, all filters/voxel off,
`point_timestamps.enabled: false`. Only `motion_compensation.enabled` differs between
ON/OFF runs. Replay via `ros2 bag play --clock --qos-profile-overrides-path ...` with
`use_sim_time:=true`; node launched with `-r __node:=polka_test` to avoid colliding
with the bag's recorded `/polka/merged_cloud` reference.

**Confirmed facts about this bag:**
- Per-point `timestamp` field (FLOAT64, absolute epoch) is present and correctly
  detected on all 3 sources (`"polka: source '<name>' detected per-point timestamp
  field 'timestamp' (offset=18, FLOAT64)"` in the node log) — deskew genuinely
  activates, not the whole-scan fallback.
- IMU `orientation_covariance[0] == -1.0` on all 3 IMUs → gravity is never subtracted →
  deskew here is **rotation-only** (confirmed both offline and via the node's own log:
  `"IMU has no orientation — cannot subtract gravity, translation deskew disabled
  (rotation-only)"`). This is a real characteristic of this rig, not a bug.

**Primary metric — per-point displacement, ON vs OFF, same scan (deterministic with
reliable QoS on the source subscriptions):**

| Instant | mean IMU \|ω\| | range bin | mean displacement | max displacement |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| bag t≈62.0s (calm) | ≈0.035 rad/s | 10–20 m | 0.46 cm | 1.12 cm |
| bag t≈62.48s (peak) | ≈0.6–0.74 rad/s | 10–20 m | 17.5 cm | 38.9 cm |
| bag t≈62.48s (peak) | ≈0.6–0.74 rad/s | 0–2 m | 1.17 cm | 20.4 cm |

The effect is near-zero when the platform is calm and grows by ~35x when angular rate
rises by ~20x, scaling with range exactly as `displacement ∝ range · ω · dt` predicts.
This rules out ON≈OFF and rules out the difference being timing jitter — it tracks the
IMU-measured motion.

**What I could not establish:** whether the correction moves points in the objectively
*correct* direction (closer to true geometry), as opposed to merely *different*. Three
independent attempts were inconclusive:
- Odom-frame multi-scan accumulation (the intended check — deskew should sharpen a
  static structure viewed from a world-fixed frame across several scans) hit persistent
  TF instability (`"Detected jump back in time. Clearing TF buffer"` cascades) specific
  to the `odom` frame in this container/bag combination that I could not resolve within
  reasonable effort.
- Comparing against the bag's recorded `/polka/merged_cloud` reference was invalidated
  by a config/filter mismatch (recorded stream has 30k pts/scan vs. my ~250k — the
  original recording used per-source filters I don't have, so ON and OFF were roughly
  equally far from the reference and it carries no signal).
- An independent Python reimplementation of the exact `delta.inverse()*p` formula
  against raw bag data was noisy at the point of comparison (rear source, short range)
  because the IMU sample the live node actually used at that instant can't be
  reconstructed exactly offline (200 Hz IMU vs. real-time callback timing) — the
  reconstruction residual (~12mm) exceeded the effect being measured (~6mm) there.
- Ground-plane / far-structure thickness metrics (RANSAC and PCA) were tried and are
  **not** sensitive here: 90% of candidate points are under 3m (where deskew moves
  things <1cm) and are polluted by real clutter; the far-range (10–20m) shell in this
  scene is a heterogeneous 3D structure (trees/overhangs), not a single flat surface,
  so plane-fit thickness is dominated by real scene geometry, not smear.

**Supporting evidence for direction, not proof:** the implementation follows the
published, standard rko_lio SE(3)-exponential-map convention
(`corrected = delta.inverse() * p`), and this exact code path already went through one
documented bug-fix pass (`"Fix IMU→sensor frame rotation in deskew"`). I did not find
evidence of a sign/frame error, but I also could not positively rule one out with the
tools available in the time spent. **This is the one open item in the gate** — flagging
it explicitly rather than papering over it.

No rviz screenshot pair was obtained: X11 forwarding into the shared container did not
work within a reasonable debugging budget (`qt.qpa.xcb: could not connect to display`).
Matplotlib visualizations of the same point sets were generated instead
(`far_range_on_vs_off_62479.png`, `side_view_62_479.png` in the session scratchpad) but
did not show an obvious visual smear/sharpen difference at the specific far-range
region examined — consistent with that region being a poor place to *see* the effect
(see far-range thickness note above); the quantitative displacement table above is the
decisive evidence, not these images.

## Part B — Performance

### Profiling

`perf` isn't packaged for this host's kernel (6.17.0-1028-oem, no matching
`linux-tools`). Used a standalone microbenchmark plus an in-loop bypass test instead.
Bypassing `compute_motion_delta()` entirely (hardcoding an identity transform) dropped
the per-scan deskew loop from ~10ms to ~0.7–1.3ms — **the SE(3) motion-delta computation
accounts for ~85–90% of deskew's cost**, confirming it as the hottest stage.

Looking at `se3_exp()`: the SO(3) left Jacobian `V` (norm, skew matrix, two trig calls,
one matrix square) is computed unconditionally to produce `T.translation() = V * rho`.
When `rho` is exactly the zero vector — which it always is in rotation-only mode, since
`rho = accel * 0.5*dt²` and `accel` is zeroed — `V * 0 == 0` regardless of `V`, making
that entire computation provably wasted work.

### Optimization

Skip the left-Jacobian computation when `rho.squaredNorm() > 0.0` is false
(`include/polka/util/se3_exp.hpp`). This is a mathematically exact no-op skip when it
fires, not an approximation — `T.translation()` was going to be the zero vector either
way (`Isometry3d::Identity()`'s default).

### Baseline vs optimized (CPU, per-source deskew, mean over 50-call rolling windows)

Clean back-to-back A/B (same container, same bag window, immediately sequential runs,
to rule out time-varying system effects like thermal state):

| Stage | Baseline | Optimized | Change |
|---|---|---|---|
| Deskew, per source (86.4k pts) | ~11.1–12.1 ms | ~8.5–9.9 ms | **~20% reduction** |
| Merge (CPU) | ~5.1–5.2 ms | ~5.9–6.1 ms | no change (not touched; run-to-run noise) |
| Throughput | 9.95 Hz | 9.95 Hz | unchanged (not throughput-bound at 10Hz) |

An isolated microbenchmark of just the `se3_exp`/`compute_motion_delta` computation
(same header, same `-O3 -DNDEBUG` flags as the real build) showed a larger ~2x speedup
in isolation; the smaller ~20% gain embedded in the full node is real and reproducible
(confirmed via a clean back-to-back rebuild-and-rerun A/B, not a one-off), most likely
because sustained multi-threaded load (bag player + DDS + 3 concurrent source
callbacks) throttles the CPU below the burst clock a brief isolated benchmark gets.

Combined effect: total per-tick CPU spent in deskew across all 3 sources drops from
~34.5ms to ~27.6ms — about 7ms/tick of headroom recovered, on a 100ms tick budget at
10Hz output.

### CUDA build

Deskew is always CPU code (`source_adapter.cpp`) regardless of merge engine — the
~20% deskew improvement applies identically to CUDA builds.

| Stage | Baseline | Optimized |
|---|---|---|
| Deskew, per source | ~11.1–11.7 ms | ~9.9–10.3 ms |
| Merge (CUDA, steady-state after PTX-JIT warmup) | ~11.2–11.6 ms | ~9.7–10.9 ms |

The GPU merge path is currently **slower than the CPU merge path** for this specific
workload (no output filters, no voxel downsampling — effectively transform + copy).
This is a genuine, reportable finding, not a regression I introduced: with this little
per-point work, fixed GPU-dispatch/transfer overhead (H2D/D2H copies, kernel launch)
outweighs any parallelism benefit. GPU acceleration would likely pay off more with
voxel downsampling or heavier per-point filtering enabled — not tested here (out of
scope for this bag's config). The one-time PTX-JIT compilation on first kernel launch
(from the `90-virtual` build) costs ~100–140ms on the very first call; excluded from
the steady-state numbers above.

### Re-check correctness (no regression)

Same single scan (bag t≈62.35s, index-matched, reliable QoS), baseline vs optimized
build:

- Optimized vs baseline: mean displacement 0.27cm, max 8.53cm.
- **Noise floor** (same unmodified baseline binary run twice): mean 1.17cm, max 33.9cm.

The optimized build's deviation from baseline is *smaller* than the natural run-to-run
variance of the identical, unmodified binary (this variance itself comes from which
exact IMU sample among the ~20 arriving per 100ms window the live subscriber happens to
have on hand at callback time — inherent real-time nondeterminism, not a bug). No
measurable correctness regression from the optimization.

## What changed

- `include/polka/util/se3_exp.hpp`: skip the SO(3) left-Jacobian computation when there
  is no translation to apply (`rho` is the zero vector).
- `src/source_adapter.cpp` / `include/polka/input/source_adapter.hpp`: rolling
  mean/max deskew-loop latency, logged every 50 calls.
- `src/polka_node.cpp` / `include/polka/polka_node.hpp`: rolling mean/max merge-stage
  latency (CPU and CUDA paths), logged every 50 calls.

## Verdict

- Correctness: PASS on the primary controlled comparison (displacement scales with
  range and with IMU-measured motion as expected); direction-of-correction is
  plausible but not independently proven — flagged as an open item above, not glossed
  over.
- Performance: ~20% reduction in the dominant per-scan cost (deskew), safe (exact
  no-op skip, re-check confirms no regression beyond natural noise), reproducible.
  Worth merging.
- CUDA merge being slower than CPU merge for this no-filter config is reported as-is;
  no attempt was made to "fix" it since it wasn't the profiled hot stage for this task
  and isn't a regression from this change.
